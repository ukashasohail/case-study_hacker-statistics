# case-study_hacker-statistics

 hacker stats just means any statistical analysis that relies heavily on simulation or re-sampling for inference.

#### here a condition is simulated that a person is walking up in a 100 floors building and a person is playing a game with his friend

### game conditions are as follow:

### person throws a dice 100 times 
#### if it's 1 or 2 person goes 1 step down
#### if it's 3,4,5 person goes 1 step up
#### if it's six person throwd a dice again and walk up resulting number of times

### also there is a chance of person falling down of stairs = 0.1% & if you fall you start again from step 0

### a person bets with his friend that he reaches 60 steps

### what is a chance that the person wins this bst?
