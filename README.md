# case-study_hacker-statistics

### Hacker stats just means any statistical analysis that relies heavily on simulation or re-sampling for inference.

#### Here a condition is simulated that a person is walking up in a 100 floors building and a person is playing a game with his friend

##### Game conditions are as follows:

Person throws a dice 100 timesif it's 1 or 2 person goes 1 step down 

If it's 3,4,5 person goes 1 step up

If it's six person throwd a dice again and walk up resulting number of times

There is also a chance of person falling down of stairs = 0.1% & if you fall you start again from step 0

##### A person bets with his friend that he reaches 60 steps

###### what is a chance that the person wins this bst?
